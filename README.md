**Nested Rectangles Detection Problem**
Nested rectangles are the one where one rectangle is within the other. Level of nested rectangle would be number of rectangles within the outermost one. Task is to identify the location of rectangles and report their level. Highlight all the rectangles found in the image. Two rectangles will not intersect.

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to detect nested rectangles in images and report number of nested rectangles present in the current rectangle using both Python and C++ implementations.

**File Structure:**
- sol_nested_rectangle.py: Python script for nested rectangles detection.
- sol_nested_rectangle.cpp: C++ program for nested rectangles detection.
- output_rectangles/: Folder to store processed images with detected rectangles.
- test_rectangles/: Folder containing sample input images for testing.

**Instructions:**
1. Ensure you have OpenCV installed in your environment.
2. For the Python solution, run "python sol_nested_rectangle.py" in a conda environment with OpenCV installed.
3. For the C++ solution, compile the program using the provided compilation command and execute the compiled executable.
4. Processed images with detected rectangles will be saved in the "output_rectangles" folder.

**Notes:**
- Both solutions require OpenCV libraries for image processing.
- Sample input images can be found in the "test_rectangles" folder.
- Ensure proper permissions and dependencies are met for compilation and execution.
- Whole code is commented. Please feel free to revert back in case of any query.
